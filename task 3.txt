Step 1: Data Generation
What happened: A synthetic dataset was created using make_classification, simulating a realistic scenario for binary classification (predicting "Purchased" or not).

Details:

Features: Five features (Age, Income, etc.).

Labels: The target variable (Purchased) has two classes: 0 (No) and 1 (Yes).

Step 2: Train-Test Split
Why: To evaluate the model's ability to generalize, we split the dataset into:

Training set: 70% of data to train the model.

Testing set: 30% to test the model.

How: Used train_test_split to ensure a random but consistent split (controlled by random_state).

Step 3: Build the Decision Tree
Classifier Used: DecisionTreeClassifier from scikit-learn.

Parameters:

max_depth=4: Limits tree depth to avoid overfitting and improve interpretability.

random_state=42: Ensures reproducibility.

Training:

The model learns decision rules from the training data to classify whether a customer will purchase or not.

Step 4: Model Evaluation
Metrics Used:

Precision: The proportion of correctly predicted positive cases out of all predicted positives.

Recall: The proportion of actual positives correctly identified.

F1-score: Balances precision and recall.

Accuracy: Overall performance (93% in this case).

Confusion Matrix:

True Positives (TP): Customers predicted to purchase and actually did.

True Negatives (TN): Customers predicted not to purchase and didn't.

False Positives (FP): Customers predicted to purchase but didn't.

False Negatives (FN): Customers predicted not to purchase but actually did.

Step 5: Visualization of Decision Tree
What it shows:

Nodes: Represent decisions based on feature values (e.g., Age < 30).

Splits: Thresholds where the data is divided for classification.

Leaf Nodes: Represent final predictions (Yes or No for purchasing).

Why it matters:

The tree structure provides interpretability, showing how decisions are made.

Each path from the root to a leaf is a rule based on feature values.

Key Insights:
The model performs well with high accuracy and balanced metrics.

Decision trees are interpretable, making them suitable for understanding customer behavior.

Fine-tuning parameters like max_depth or using pruning can improve performance and prevent overfitting.
