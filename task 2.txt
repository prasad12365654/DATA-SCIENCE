Step 1: Load the Dataset
Objective: Import the dataset into the workspace.

Details: Use Python libraries like pandas to read a CSV file or similar formats. If the dataset is hosted online, libraries like Seaborn allow direct loading (when internet access is available).

Step 2: Understand the Data Structure
Objective: Get an initial understanding of the dataset's contents.

Actions:

Inspect Columns: Identify the variables (e.g., age, fare, survived).

Check Data Types: Ensure the data types (numeric, categorical, datetime) are correct.

Summary Statistics: Look at measures like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.

Step 3: Data Cleaning
Objective: Ensure the dataset is accurate, consistent, and complete.

Common Issues:

Missing Values:

Replace missing numerical values (e.g., age) with the mean or median.

Replace missing categorical values (e.g., embarked) with the mode or a specific label.

Duplicate Rows:

Identify and remove duplicate rows if they exist.

Outliers:

Detect unusual values in numeric columns like fare or age using visualization or statistics.

Incorrect Data Types:

Convert columns like age or fare to numeric if needed.

Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA explores relationships, trends, and distributions.

Univariate Analysis (Single Variable)
Goal: Understand the distribution of individual columns.

Techniques:

Histograms (e.g., for age distribution).

Bar charts (e.g., for sex or class frequencies).

Boxplots (e.g., to identify age outliers).

Bivariate Analysis (Two Variables)
Goal: Explore relationships between two variables.

Examples:

Categorical vs Numerical:

Compare fare (numerical) across class (categorical) using boxplots.

Categorical vs Categorical:

Use stacked bar charts to analyze survival (survived) across genders (sex).

Numerical vs Numerical:

Create scatter plots for variables like age and fare.

Multivariate Analysis (Multiple Variables)
Goal: Understand relationships involving more than two variables.

Example:

Analyze how survived depends on class and sex using heatmaps or grouped bar charts.

Step 5: Identify Trends and Patterns
Objective: Summarize findings and draw insights.

Examples:

Were women and children more likely to survive?

Did higher fares correlate with survival rates?

How did survival vary across passenger classes?
