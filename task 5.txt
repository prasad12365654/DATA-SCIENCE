Step 1: Data Collection
Pin: Collect data from reliable sources (e.g., government traffic departments or repositories).
To Pin:

Example: A dataset might include fields like:

Date and Time of accidents.

Road Conditions (e.g., wet, icy).

Weather (e.g., clear, rainy).

Severity (e.g., minor, severe).

Latitude and Longitude for geospatial mapping.

Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Pin: Prepare the dataset for analysis by cleaning and organizing it.
To Pin:

Handle Missing Data:

Replace null values in Weather or Road Conditions with "Unknown" or the most frequent value.

Standardize Labels:

Ensure labels like "Rainy" and "Rain" are consistent.

Feature Engineering:

Extract time-based features (hour, weekday) from timestamps.

Categorize severity levels into buckets (e.g., Minor, Major).

Geospatial Data:

Ensure Latitude and Longitude values are correctly formatted for mapping.

Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Pin: Explore patterns and relationships in the data.
To Pin:

Univariate Analysis:

Count of accidents by weather type (e.g., most accidents during "Rainy" weather).

Distribution of accidents across times of the day.

Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis:

How road conditions and weather jointly influence accident severity.

Accident frequency by time and location.

Step 4: Visualization
Pin: Represent data visually to highlight patterns.
To Pin:

Heatmaps:

Display accident hotspots geographically using Latitude and Longitude.

Bar/Line Charts:

Show accident trends by hour, weather, or day of the week.

Scatter Plots:

Relate weather conditions to accident severity.

Calendar Plots:

Visualize the distribution of accidents over days and months.

Step 5: Insights
Pin: Derive actionable insights from the analysis.
To Pin:

Identify high-risk areas (hotspots) where accidents occur frequently.

Assess how weather (e.g., "Rainy") and road conditions (e.g., "Icy") impact accident severity.

Highlight peak accident times (e.g., rush hours, weekends).
