Let’s break down the histogram step by step:

1. Data:
The data represents the ages of 200 individuals, ranging between 10 and 80 years.

This dataset is grouped into intervals or "bins" to summarize the distribution.

2. Bins:
Each bar (bin) covers a specific age range, such as 10–15, 15–20, and so on.

The number of bins (14 in this case) determines the granularity of the age distribution. More bins show finer details; fewer bins provide a broader overview.

3. X-axis (Age):
The x-axis represents the range of ages. For example:

The first bin corresponds to ages 10–15.

The second bin corresponds to ages 15–20.

This pattern continues up to 75–80.

4. Y-axis (Frequency):
The y-axis indicates the number of individuals within each age range.

For example:

If a bar has a height of 20, it means there are 20 individuals in that age range.

5. Bar Height:
Each bar's height shows how many people belong to the corresponding age range.

Taller bars mean more individuals in that range; shorter bars mean fewer.

6. Design Choices:
Color: The bars are filled with a light blue color for clarity.

Edges: Black edges around the bars help distinguish them.

Gridlines: Horizontal gridlines improve readability.

7. Insights:
The histogram visually highlights patterns, such as:

Age ranges with the highest or lowest number of individuals.

Whether the distribution is uniform, skewed, or clustered around certain ages.
